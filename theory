ChatGPT
Implementing linear regression using a deep neural network for the Boston housing price prediction problem involves several steps, including data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and interpretation. Let's break down each step:

Understanding the Dataset:
The Boston housing price prediction dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston, Massachusetts. It includes various features such as crime rate, number of rooms, pupil-teacher ratio, etc., and the target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes.
Data Preprocessing:
Load the dataset and split it into features (input) and target variable (output).
Normalize the features to have zero mean and unit variance to ensure faster convergence during training.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Model Building:
Construct a deep neural network with one input layer, one output layer, and no activation function (since we're performing linear regression).
The input layer will have the same number of nodes as the number of features, and the output layer will have one node for the predicted housing price.
Training:
Compile the model with an appropriate loss function, such as mean squared error, and an optimizer like stochastic gradient descent or Adam.
Train the model on the training data, specifying the number of epochs (iterations over the entire dataset) and the batch size.
Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like mean squared error, mean absolute error, etc.
Visualize the predicted prices against the actual prices to assess the model's accuracy.
Interpretation:
Analyze the model's coefficients (weights) to understand which features have the most significant impact on the predicted housing prices.
Discuss any limitations or assumptions made during the modeling process.
Commonly asked interview questions and their answers:

Why do we use a deep neural network for linear regression?
Deep neural networks provide a flexible framework for modeling complex relationships between input features and target variables, even in cases where the relationship is not strictly linear. While linear regression itself is a simple and interpretable model, using a neural network allows us to capture nonlinear patterns in the data.
What is the purpose of data normalization in deep learning?
Data normalization ensures that all features have a similar scale, preventing features with larger magnitudes from dominating the training process. This helps in faster convergence during training and can also improve the performance of the model.
How do you choose the number of layers and nodes in a neural network for linear regression?
For linear regression, a single layer with one node in the output layer suffices, as we are essentially performing a weighted sum of the input features. Adding more layers or nodes would introduce unnecessary complexity and computational overhead without providing significant benefits.
What loss function is commonly used for linear regression in deep learning?
The mean squared error (MSE) loss function is commonly used for linear regression in deep learning. It calculates the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values and is well-suited for regression problems.
How do you interpret the coefficients (weights) in a linear regression neural network?
The coefficients represent the importance of each input feature in predicting the target variable. A higher absolute value of a coefficient indicates a stronger impact of that feature on the predicted output. Positive coefficients imply a positive correlation, while negative coefficients imply a negative correlation with the target variable.
What are some limitations of using deep neural networks for linear regression?
Deep neural networks may suffer from overfitting if the model architecture is too complex relative to the size of the dataset. Additionally, deep learning models require large amounts of data and computational resources for training, which may not always be available or feasible. Moreover, interpreting the results of a deep neural network can be challenging compared to simpler linear regression models.
